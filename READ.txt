At the backend we create a class named Display with a method called gmap, which takes two parameters, one is the address and the other is the url, calls the API using the curl operation and returns the response here (here we have hard-coded the sample response). Then the Display class object is created and the response is printed using the address and url entered by the user.
In the front end create a text box called address and another button, when the button is clicked an event will occur in which the text entered in the text box will be fetched using the id attribute then an ajax call will be made and the address will be passed along with it, after getting the response the latitude and longitude and will take, both these values ​​will be passed as parameters to the function and will display the both maps.
